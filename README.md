# CR-Website
- Trying to experiment with the Clash Royale API
- Trying to make a website like RoyaleAPI or Stats Royale
- I think I'll call this Clashalytics (Clash Royale + Analytics), but I'm not sure
- This project will likely take a while since I'm only one person
- Hopefully, I don't give up on this halfway through like my CR Parody repo
- Link to working version (albeit several commits behind the GitHub version) can be found at: https://clashalytics.herokuapp.com/
- Idk if anyone is going to read this, but I'll just end the readme here
